To create a simple Python program that reads a demo image and represents it into training and testing data (`X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test`), we'll use the popular `sklearn` library along with `matplotlib` for image loading and visualization. Here's a step-by-step implementation:

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

### Step 3: Load and Process Demo Image

For simplicity, let's use a sample image provided by `matplotlib`.

```python
# Load a sample image from matplotlib
from sklearn.datasets import load_sample_image
demo_image = load_sample_image("flower.jpg")

# Display the image
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.imshow(demo_image)
plt.title('Sample Image')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

### Step 4: Prepare Data for Machine Learning

```python
# Convert image to grayscale for simplicity
gray_image = np.mean(demo_image, axis=2)

# Reshape the image to 1D array for X
X = gray_image.reshape(-1, 1)  # Flatten the image to a column vector

# Generate dummy y labels
y = np.zeros(len(X))  # Dummy labels, since it's an unsupervised example

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Print shapes of train and test sets
print("X_train shape:", X_train.shape)
print("X_test shape:", X_test.shape)
print("y_train shape:", y_train.shape)
print("y_test shape:", y_test.shape)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries including `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot` for visualization, and `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.

2. **Load and Display Demo Image**: Use `load_sample_image` from `sklearn.datasets` to load a sample image (`flower.jpg`) provided by `matplotlib`. Display the image using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow`.

3. **Prepare Data for Machine Learning**:
   - Convert the loaded image to grayscale (`np.mean(demo_image, axis=2)`).
   - Flatten the grayscale image into a 1D array (`X`).
   - Generate dummy labels (`y`) since it's an unsupervised example.

4. **Split Data**: Use `train_test_split` to split data (`X` and `y`) into training (`X_train`, `y_train`) and testing (`X_test`, `y_test`) sets. Adjust `test_size` and `random_state` as needed.

5. **Print Shapes**: Display the shapes (`shape`) of the training and testing sets to verify dimensions.

### Notes:

- This example treats the problem as unsupervised, where `y` is just dummy labels. For supervised learning, you would need actual labels corresponding to your data.
- Replace `flower.jpg` with any other image filename or path to use a different image.
- Adjust `test_size` in `train_test_split` to control the ratio of training and testing data.
- This script provides a basic framework for loading and preparing image data for machine learning tasks. Depending on your specific AI application, you may need additional preprocessing steps or different libraries.

By following these steps, you can create a simple Python program that loads an image, prepares it for machine learning, and splits it into training and testing sets.
